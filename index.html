          <p>This is a collection of skins and hats from Bubla.io, Xgar.io, Fanix.io, Bublex.io, and Sphera_Connect (when that still had an IO game).</p>
          <p>I will be using skins to refer to both Skins and Hats.</p>
          <p>
            The skins made specifically for these games are made by Jurassic/Luca (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Xgarioml">https://www.youtube.com/@Xgarioml</a> or
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bublez">https://www.youtube.com/@bublez</a>), BenciARTz (Link Here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TimberAgario">https://www.youtube.com/@TimberAgario</a>), Zero
            (No link), and Shakura from Shady (Shakura and Andy. Link Here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HibbohotelNL">https://www.youtube.com/@HibbohotelNL</a>). Other skins were made by GetDeadKid (<a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/@GetDeadKids"
              >https://www.youtube.com/@GetDeadKids</a>) or just random images Luca used (Like with Burnman and Fishy)
          </p>
          <p>
            This collection is incomplete because some skins and hats are missing. You can find references of them in the "Missing" folder, however for some, I can't find a reference for. If you have any of them,
            even the ones I remade, please post them in an issue on the repo for this project. You can remake them if you want but the goal is to have the original skins and hats, not recreations. So yes,
            recreations still count as missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some skins that were obtained from Bublex: "Chick", "Friday", "Man", and "Snowman 1", as well as a YouTube profile picture: "Evil Ghost", and Instagram: "Coin 3" have what looks like JPEG compression
            artifacts (The "Coin 3" file I downloaded is a JPEG so that makes sense), which can make the skins look blurry if you use them in-game. If you have any of these skins without artifacts please post
            them in an issue on the repo for this project.
          </p>
          <!--Fun fact: I tried to purchase skins and hats from Bubla, Xgar and Fanix from Mistik, the guy who owns Senpa.io and NBK clan, because he apparently owns them too (I guess owned, not sure if he still does since It's been a year). Instead of getting those skins and hats, I paid $200 for skins from when Bublex was still around, and they resized and added borders to them (If you want to see them, they're in their own folder in the Bublex folder). Safe to say I kinda got scammed, but was partly my fault. Mistik did show a preview of what I was getting, so I did technically get what I paid for, but he only showed the file names, and I should've looked closer at them and asked to see the previews of the skin images to make sure I was getting the right thing. I don't want any drama to come from me saying this, I don't even know if Mistik meant to scam me. There is a chance that he got scammed and didn't know it. I don't know. I am not him. I don't want to make any false assumptions. I'm just sharing my experience.</p> -->
          <p>Here are some answers to questions you may have. If you have any questions that aren't answered in this list, please post them in an issue on the repo for this project.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Why are you doing this?</p>
              <p>
                The same reason I support "Stop Killing Games"; I think media and art preservation is extremely important and something everyone should care about. I don't think media should be lost to time, it's a part of history after all. And when it comes to these
                skins, to me, they represent my favorite era of web-games, no matter how toxic, reactionary, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqG6QN3_fqo">shady</a> a lot of the people were/are. Also, I just want them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Why do you count skins as "missing" even if they are in the Resized and Borderd Bublex.io skin catagory? And why don't you use them as references.</p>
              <p>Because those skins are edited and I want skins that are as close to the originals as possible. I don't use them as references becasuse I think that would be kinda confusing.</p>
